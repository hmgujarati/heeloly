A complete full-stack application has been built using React for the frontend, FastAPI (Python) for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The application features the requested Gothic dark fantasy UI/UX and is fully dynamic. All content, including books, FAQs, and extras, is managed through a comprehensive admin panel and served from the database. The initial data from the user's documents has been seeded into the database.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was asked to run a deployment health check. It called the  but the process was interrupted by a user query.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** The agent should call the  again to run a full health check on the frontend and backend to ensure the application is stable and ready for deployment.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0):** Deployment Health Check is incomplete.
-   **Issue 2 (P1):** The newsletter popup appears on every page load, obstructing views during testing and potentially harming user experience.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Deployment Health Check Incomplete**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent initiated a call to the , which was interrupted.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** Re-initiate the call to the  to perform a thorough health check of both frontend and backend services to validate deployment readiness.
    -   **Why fix this issue?** To confirm that the application is stable and free of critical errors before handing it off for deployment on the user's VPS.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both (via the deployment agent).

-   **Issue 2: Aggressive Newsletter Popup**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent has been manually closing it for screenshots.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Edit  and its implementation in .
        2.  Use  or  to show the popup only once per user session.
        3.  Set a flag (e.g., ) after the first display or when the user closes it, and check for this flag before rendering the popup again.
    -   **Why fix this issue?** To improve the overall user experience and simplify testing by preventing the popup from blocking content on every navigation.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.

**In progress Task List**:
- There are no partially completed tasks apart from the pending health check.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Stack:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Authentication:** A simple, secure admin login using  for password hashing.
-   **Data Flow:** The React frontend fetches all its content dynamically from the FastAPI backend, which in turn retrieves data from the MongoDB database.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The application was fundamentally changed from a static React site to a full-stack, database-driven web application.
-    was added to the backend dependencies for security.

**All files of reference**
-   : The core FastAPI application serving all content and handling admin functions.
-   : The main component for the entire admin panel.
-   : The entry point for the admin section.
-   : Contains all the routing logic for public and admin pages.
-    & : Define the visual theme and layout of the site.
-   : The primary deployment guide for the user.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  directory contains old, unused page components from before the full-stack rebuild. These files should be identified and deleted to clean up the project.

**key api endpoints**
-   , ,  (Full CRUD)
-   ,  (POST for submission, GET for admin view)
-    (POST for authentication)
-    (POST for password updates)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The application has been completely rebuilt. Focus on the new dynamic structure and disregard the initial static implementation.
-   The user intends to deploy on a VPS. The main guide is .
-   The key new feature is the admin panel. Access it at  with the password  for testing. You can change this password in the Settings tab of the dashboard.
